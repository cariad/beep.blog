Bloomberg, "[Twitter Considers Subscription Fee for Tweetdeck, Unique Content](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-08/twitter-considers-subscription-fee-for-tweetdeck-unique-content?utm_source=url_link)":

> "Youâ€™ll be able to see us try all kinds of different things," he [Twitter Chief Financial Officer, Ned Segal] said in early December at a Bank of America conference.

I'll pay Jack Dorsey some dollars per month when I can get someone at Twitter to acknowledge my abuse reports.

I'm not even talking about having someone _act_ on my reports. I just want a human being at Twitter to acknowledge the harm their platform enables.

I'll pay for human support. I don't need anything more complex than that.

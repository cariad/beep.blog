title: I ranked 7th in the Aseprite Mini Weekend Jam!
---

I took park in the Aseprite[^aseprite] Mini Weekend Jam[^jam] last week and ranked 7th[^seventh] of 21 by a jury of my peers!

[^aseprite]: Aseprite ([aseprite.org](https://www.aseprite.org)) is a _hugely_ popular--probably the _most_ popular, but I'm not going to double-check so don't quote me--open-source pixel art and animation editor. The jam wasn't associated or endorsed by the Aseprite crew, but there you go and now you know.

The jam lasted 48 hours with the theme "Offworld Refugee" and required three deliverables:

1. A protagonist.
2. A companion to the protagonist.
3. A scene capturing a moment.

â€¦and for only 48 hours, actually finishing something and ranking seventh ain't bad!

| Criteria                        | Rank  | Score     |
| -                               | -     | -         |
| Overall                         |    #7 | 3.762 / 5 |
| Creativity & originality?       |    #6 | 3.786 / 5 |
| Interpretation of the theme     |    #7 | 3.786 / 5 |
| Quality of artistic composition |   #10 | 3.714 / 5 |

I'm honestly really happy with the character images; I got into the flow and had fun with it. But I fucked myself with the scene capturing a moment. I ran out of time, had to rush it, and I didn't do the idea justice at all. So, no hard feelings on losing points for that.

Am I just the _smallest_ bit grumpy about the folks who adapted existing work rather then starting from scratch? Hell yes; you know I am. But fuck 'em, because I'm proud enough of what I put out there.

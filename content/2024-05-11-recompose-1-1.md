title: Recompose v1.1; now with missing data handling!
---

[Last July]({{< ref "2023-07-23-rolumns-1-3-recompose-1" >}}), I released
[Recompose](https://github.com/cariad/recompose): a Python package for
recomposing data by following instructional schemas.

Eh?

## Let me explain

Let's say, for example, you've got this data set:

```json
{
  "2023-06-04": {
    "groups": {
      "chefs": [
        {
          "name": "Alice"
        },
        {
          "name": "Bob"
        }
      ],
      "firefighters": [
        {
          "name": "Daniel"
        },
        {
          "name": "Esther"
        }
      ],
      "zookeepers": [
        {
          "name": "Gregory"
        },
        {
          "name": "Harold"
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "2023-06-05": {
    "groups": {
      "chefs": [
        {
          "namQe": "Jet"
        },
        {
          "name": "Karen"
        }
      ],
      "firefighters": [
        {
          "name": "Mater"
        },
        {
          "name": "Nigel"
        }
      ],
      "zookeepers": [
        {
          "name": "Peter"
        },
        {
          "name": "Quentin"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

…and let's say you want to reduce those two "firefighters" arrays down to just
their first values.

(It's a niche problem, I grant you--but it's one that trips me up on the regular.)

With Recompose, you can apply that transformation via this schema:

```json
{
    "version": 1,
    "on": "each-value",
    "perform": {
        "path": "groups",
        "cursor": {
            "perform": {
                "path": "firefighters",
                "cursor": {
                    "perform": "list-to-object"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In a nutshell, this directs Recompose to:

1. Run a cursor over every root value (`"on": "each-value"`), and within that:
1. Run a cursor over each child record's "groups" key (`"path": "groups"`), and
within that:
1. Perform the "list-to-object" transformation (`"perform": "list-to-object"`)
on each child record's "firefighters" key (`"path": "firefighters"`).

The schema is applied and data recomposed with this code:

```python
from recompose import transform

transformed = transform(
    schema,
    data,
)
```

…and the result is _this_ data set:

```json
{
  "2023-06-04": {
    "groups": {
      "chefs": [
        {
          "name": "Alice"
        },
        {
          "name": "Bob"
        }
      ],
      "firefighters": {
        "name": "Daniel"
      },
      "zookeepers": [
        {
          "name": "Gregory"
        },
        {
          "name": "Harold"
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "2023-06-05": {
    "groups": {
      "chefs": [
        {
          "name": "Jet"
        },
        {
          "name": "Karen"
        }
      ],
      "firefighters": {
        "name": "Mater"
      },
      "zookeepers": [
        {
          "name": "Peter"
        },
        {
          "name": "Quentin"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## But…

But what happens if the schema describes a `path` that doesn't exist?

Recompose v1.0 _requires_ paths to exist, and bones out with a `KeyError` if
they don't.

Recompose v1.1, though--which I just released--has a new `Options` class so you
can decide for yourself whether Recompose skips that transformation or fails:

```python
from recompose import Allow, Options, transform

options = Options(
    missing_data=Allow.ALLOW,
)

transformed = transform(
    schema,
    data,
    options=options,
)
```

And that's the lot!

## Recompose v1.1

Recompose v1.1 requires Python 3.9 or later and can be installed from
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/recompose/) at your leisure:

```shell
pip install recompose
```

The code is released under the MIT licence at
[github.com/cariad/recompose](https://github.com/cariad/recompose), too, and
documented at [cariad.github.io/recompose](https://cariad.github.io/recompose/).

Have fun!

title: LambdaQ v2; now with optional task tokens!
---

[LambdaQ](https://github.com/cariad/lambdaq) ("lambda-queue") is my Python
package that helps you write Amazon Web Services Lambda functions that can be
called directly _and_ by messages on SQS queues. The package takes care of the
event handling, message deserialisation and API calls, while you focus on
writing decoupled, testable message-handling code.

Now… it turns out that [v1]({{< ref "2024-04-11-lambdaq-1-0-0" >}}) makes the
slightly short-sighted assumption that messages are published onto queues _only_
by Step Functions state machines and _always_ with task tokens to describe
success or failure.

And that put me on the spot today when I needed to publish to a queue directly
in code. A Step Functions token doesn't make sense when you're publishing
outside of Step Functions--and even if you _are_ using Step Functions, you don't
always want to publish and wait for a response.

Tokens should be optional. So, in
[v2](https://github.com/cariad/lambdaq/releases/tag/2.0.0), they are! And…
that's about it. I bumped the major version up only because
[I adjusted the argument order](https://github.com/cariad/lambdaq/commit/d612e34646d51e71be97454a1128d036acb5e0cc#diff-d98ffd391206e133c0737de766328fd491ff94330a323b433fc492bf5f821650L16)
of `handle_event` to maintain alphabetical order. That sort of thing bothers me
perhaps more than it ought to.

Anyway, that's the lot! LambdaQ v2 requires Python 3.10 or later and can be
installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/lambdaq/).

```shell
pip install lambdaq
```

The code is released under the MIT licence at
[github.com/cariad/lambdaq](https://github.com/cariad/lambdaq), too.

Have fun!

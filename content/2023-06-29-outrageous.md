title: Is it outrageous that Apple continues to advertise on Twitter?

[John Gruber asks and answers](https://daringfireball.net/2023/06/apple_silo_twitter):

> Is it outrageous that Apple continues to advertise on Twitter? I say no. But it feels a bit skeevy, and more than a little curious, that they choose to.

Is it outrageous? _My_ gut said yes.

It's outrageous that Apple would change their logo for Pride, publish some puff about "love is love", then give their marketing money to a platform that [removed trans folks' protection against harassment](https://glaad.org/releases/glaad-responds-twitters-roll-back-long-standing-lgbtq-hate-speech-policy) and [considers "cis" a slur](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1671370284102819841). It's outrageous that Apple would be so hypocritical as to campaign for and against queer equality.

But you know what? Apple _didn't_ change their logo for Pride. Apple _didn't_, as far as I can see, publish any performative solidarity.

There are no hypocrites at Apple Marketing. They went all-in on [the guy who wants to imprison therapists who care for transgender youth](https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/musk-i-will-lobby-to-criminalize) and the platform being threatened with [a daily $700,000 fine by the Australian government for hosting hate speech](https://gizmodo.com/twitter-australia-elon-musk-fine-hate-speech-1850564669).

So, is it outrageous that Apple continues to advertise on Twitter? I agree with John and say no. But don't let the bastards convince you we have allies in Cupertino while they're funding hate.
